About
=====
This project is my personal modification of Wrestling MPire Remix, the legendary wrestling PC game made by MDickie.

The features will be quite random. For now, all I want is the ability to play with 4 gamepads, making this an epic multiplayer phenomenon for me and my friends.

How to use
==========
For now, you'll have to download the sources and compile them using Blitz3D in the game's install directory.

When I deem this working and there is no license trouble, I might distribute an executable that one would simply have to put into the game's install directory.
